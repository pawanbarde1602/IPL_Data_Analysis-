## 🚀 New Project Completed: IPL Data Analysis 🏏

I recently worked on an exciting project where I analyzed IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Python and JupyterLab.

🔹 Explored match and player statistics
🔹 Performed data cleaning and visualization
🔹 Discovered trends in team performance, top players, and match outcomes
🔹 Built insights to understand how data can reveal hidden patterns in sports

This project not only strengthened my data analysis, Python, and visualization skills but also gave me a deeper appreciation of how data drives decisions in sports analytics.

💡 Looking forward to applying these skills to more real-world datasets and projects!
